# R as a Calculator 

The first thing we will learn is how to use R as a calculator. You can use any of the math operators you want:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `^` Exponentiation 

Let's experiment with some arithmetic expressions: 

```{r}
1 + 1

2 / 4
```



Order of operations apply here too. Lets try this:


### Exercise

Compute the sample average of the following sample of baby weights (in lbs.):

(7.7, 8.2, 8.3, 7.6, 9.2, 7.4, 11.1)

```{r}

```



# R as a functional programming language

R is based around functions. A function takes an input (or multiple inputs) and produces an output. There are many many functions in R, but first lets learn some calculator type functions. For example, if I want to take the square root, I can use the function `sqrt`. Here are some example of math functions:

Note the form of a function call:

1. The function name, `sqrt`, `abs`, `factorial`
2. Opening parenthesis `(`
3. The argument (in the future arguments)
4. Closing parenthesis `)`

For example `sqrt(16)` says to take the argument `16` and apply the function `sqrt` of it.

### Exercise

Calculate the square root of 147

```{r}

```

Practical usage: say the $Var(x) = 12$ and we have a sample size of 55. 
What is the variance of the sample distribution of the sample mean?

```{r}

```


# Creating Variables

Variables are immensely helpful in R. It lets you store values by giving them a `name` and then lets you access the variables later by name. I can assign variables using either `<-` or `=`. 

Create variable x with value 5 and a variable y with value 20.

```{r}

```


What is the sum of `x` and `y`?

```{r}

```

Note the form of creating the variable:

1. The variable name, `x` and `y`
2. Assignment operator `<-` or `=`
3. The value we want to store.

We can store even complex values. Let's say I want to calculate the mean of the sample of birthweights above and store this for later use.

```{r}

```

You can create a variable containing text by using `""`

```{r}
instructor_name <- ""
print(instructor_name)
```



### Exercise

Use quotation marks to create a string and call it `my_name`.

```{r}

```



# Vectors 

Vectors are a list of elements like integers, numbers, or strings. This is really useful for storing data! You use `c` to create a vector (c for combine).

```{r}

```

You can access elements of a vector by using `[#]`, where `#` is the n-th element you want 

```{r}

```

Standard math operators work on vectors element by element:

```{r}

```

The math functions we learn also operate element by element:

```{r}

```

What happens when we add two vectors?

```{r}

```


### Summarizing vectors

Typically, a vector contains observations of a particular variable. For example, let's create a vector of our baby weight sample:

```{r}
baby_weights <- c(7.7, 8.2, 8.3, 7.6, 9.2, 7.4, 11.1)
print(baby_weights)
```

R comes with a bunch of statistical functions that can be used to summarize variables: `summary()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `var()`, `sd()`, `fivenum()`, `IQR()`, `min()`, `max()`


Let's try to calculate the mean and standard deviation of birth weight:

```{r}

```

It appears that we have an outlier in our data. Let's use the five number summary instead:

```{r}

```


### Exercise

Try to find the mean and median of the total rebounds from the 1991-1992 NBA season.

```{r}
rebounds <- c(260, 114, 252, 310, 165, 236, 148, 336, 941, 127, 384, 278, 300, 6, 136, 145, 233, 142, 420, 35, 11, 161, 485, 1, 830, 81, 112, 16, 63, 513, 162, 296, 434, 239, 22, 269, 235, 222, 485, 245, 578, 162, 281, 344, 39, 99, 82, 79, 476, 3, 69, 84, 201, 52, 223, 244, 34, 728, 5, 423, 286, 346, 324, 549, 580, 152, 401, 58, 95, 187, 618, 189, 69, 184, 34, 101, 36, 7, 472, 78, 41, 631, 259, 12, 760, 33, 410, 672, 70, 227, 272, 247, 289, 63, 96, 500, 497, 739, 188, 178, 491, 1, 298, 202, 211, 307, 227, 439, 253, 24, 740, 168, 921, 61, 210, 213, 209, 150, 145, 220, 26, 144, 286, 190, 56, 182, 580, 105, 402, 660, 260, 118, 0, 231, 11, 184, 69, 432, 807, 257, 762, 24, 42, 342, 95, 185, 77, 310, 170, 447, 98, 271, 8, 41, 99, 85, 102, 593, 275, 24, 10, 206, 407, 51, 184, 0, 98, 10, 305, 43, 112, 30, 80, 312, 292, 292, 899, 182, 317, 511, 665, 78, 633, 314, 32, 11, 49, 205, 402, 296, 46, 26, 261, 429, 451, 66, 546, 206, 35, 5, 63, 161, 227, 394, 308, 118, 92, 249, 691, 257, 85, 220, 483, 233, 909, 744, 564, 208, 573, 25, 243, 16, 2, 30, 132, 34, 468, 460, 330, 268, 1, 252, 318, 453, 473, 33, 82, 494, 26, 450, 54, 110, 145, 870, 670, 111, 1, 179, 448, 700, 74, 845, 30, 27, 639, 15, 97, 705, 96, 54, 295, 312, 556, 39, 551, 426, 45, 258, 8, 233, 564, 630, 536, 5, 255, 95, 173, 11, 51, 106, 71, 393, 317, 149, 394, 301, 319, 19, 147, 257, 336, 350, 19, 416, 829, 2, 219, 1530, 171, 124, 54, 47, 296, 30, 26, 96, 168, 14, 118, 770, 310, 66, 934, 42, 415, 204, 634, 202, 301, 391, 177, 81, 256, 116, 188, 76, 417, 1, 28, 435, 191, 449, 270, 265, 5, 1, 0, 47, 183, 0, 22, 247, 0, 381, 19, 2, 862, 253, 469, 55, 37, 90, 246, 78, 88, 512, 0, 101, 265, 28, 238, 223, 257, 372, 21, 236, 94, 81, 295, 206, 704, 454, 607, 145, 129, 282, 405, 247, 1258, 15, 269, 9, 240, 260, 305, 75)
```



# Missing Data


In R, `NA` is a very special value meaning "Not Available"/"Missing". This comes up a lot in real world datasets. For example, maybe individuals don't answer a survey question. Lets say that for some reason, baby weights has a missing observation.

```{r Create vector with NA}
baby_weights <- c(baby_weights, NA)
baby_weights
```

Try a few of the summary functions and see what happens. 

```{r}
mean(baby_weights)

median(baby_weights)
```


## Confusiong over functions

You can use `help("function name")` or `?function name` to get information the command. Type `help("sum")` to see how to fix this problem. 

```{r}
help("mean")
```



```{r}
mean(baby_weights, na.rm = TRUE)
```


# Using Data in R

In R, you can either load data from a website or from a computer. Usually data is found in a .csv file, but sometimes it will be in different forms that R can read.  

```{r "Loading Data from Website"}
# From a website
fandago <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylebutts/UARK_4753/main/R_Days/fandango_score_comparison.csv")
head(fandago)
```

However, most common is to download the data and put it in the folder where your `.Rmd` file is. To load data you will need to find the file location. 
Remember to set your working directory for this.

```{r "Loading Data from Computer"}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv")
```

## Dataframes

Dataframes are a special object in R. The columns of a dataframe are each vectors that contain variables and a row contains an observation. If you are using RStudio, clicking the dataframe in the `Environment` tab or typing `View(dataframe)` into the console will let you interactively scroll though the data. 

Another useful function is the `head()` function. The first argument is a dataframe. It prints out the first 5 rows of the dataset so you can see the variables

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

### Exercise

What constitutes a row in the penguins dataframe? What constitutes a column?



## Accessing individual observations/variables

To access an individual variable, we can use the `$` operator. We use the `dataframe$varible` symbol to extract `variable` from the `dataframe`. For example, let's grab the species variable from penguins

Try grabing the `species` and the `sex` variables us

```{r}

```

The `[,]` operator wil let us subset rows and columns. Before comma = rows and After comma = columns

```{r}
penguins[1:5,"species"]
```

```{r}
penguins[1:5,]
```

```{r}
penguins[,"species"]
```

```{r}
penguins[1:10, c("species", "island")]
```

```{r}
penguins[c(TRUE, FALSE), ]
```


You can pair these together, for example let's say I want the variable `island` for the first 6 observations:

```{r}
penguins[1:6, "island"]
penguins[1:6, ]$island
```



### Exercise

Use the `unique()` function to find the unique values of the variable `species` in the penguins dataset.

```{r}

```



## Selecting rows based on criteria

Lets see which penguins live on Torgersen.

We can use the `==` operator to compare a vector to a value (or set of values). 
For example, here we see if each penguin's island is `"Torgersen"`. 
It produces a `boolean` vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

```{r}
on_torgersen <- penguins$island == "Torgersen"
on_torgersen
```


We can subset the data using a boolen vector.

```{r}
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]$body_mass_g
```

You can also use the following operators to supply multiple criteria:

- `&` And operator. Both vector 1 **and** vector 2 must be true for the observation
- `|` Or operator. **Either** vector 1 **or** vector 2 must be true for the observation

```{r}
penguins$island == "Torgersen" & penguins$sex == "male"
penguins$island == "Torgersen" | penguins$sex == "male"
```


### Exercise

Subset the `penguins` dataframe to male penguins that weigh over 3500 grams

```{r}

```


### Exercise

Try and answer the following question: 
Are all three species present on the Torgersen island? 

```{r}

```



### Exercise

![Penguin Beak Measurements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/culmen_depth.png)

Lets compare Bill Length between the three species of penguins in our dataset: the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.

Using `[]` and `<-`, create 3 dataframes called `penguins_ad`, `penguins_gent`, and `penguins_chin` that subset based on the correct species of penguins.

"Adelie", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap"

```{r}

```


What is the mean of each species bill length in millimeters? (remember there are NAs so we will need to use `na.rm = TRUE`).

```{r}

```


# Creating new variables

We can create variables in our dataset by using the `$` or `[]` operators with `<-`.

```{r}
penguins$body_mass_g

# 0.0022 lbs = 1 g
penguins$body_mass_lb <- 0.00220462 * penguins$body_mass_g
```


### Exericse

Your R exercise asks you to calculate the standard deviation without using the `var()` or `sd()` command. We want to remove `NA`s manually to fix this. A helpful command is `is.na()`. Let's practice computing the variance of body_mass_lb by hand. You will want to use `nrow()`

```{r}

```



# Graphing Data

## Histograms

Common functions for graphing are `hist()` for plotting one variable and `plot()` for plotting two variables. 

```{r}
# Count
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```

You can add additional commands for better plots. Use `?hist` or `help("hist")` to see the list of options. 

### Exercise

Type `?hist` into the console and Find the following options:

- Find the option that will give you probabilities

```{r}
# Probability
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```

- the bar color
- the number of breaks
- the x-axis label
- add a title


```{r}
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb, main = "Penguins Weight in lbs.", xlab = "Weight (lbs.)", col = "pink")
```

### Exercise

Compare this distributions of `bill_length_mm` for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. 


```{r}

```




## Scatter Plots

While we haven't talked about this yet, it is typically of interest to compare multiple variables together. To plot two variables, we will use the `plot()` function to make scatter plots.

```{r}
plot(body_mass_lb ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)
plot(penguins$body_mass_lb ~ penguins$flipper_length_mm)
plot(y = penguins$body_mass_lb, x = penguins$flipper_length_mm, main = "Scatter plot of ...")
```







## (optional) ggplot2

There is a package called `ggplot2` that improves base Rs graphing library. We will not cover the details here, but a curious student can find much more details here: https://ggplot2-book.org/

This is a particularly nice introduction: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/post/06-ggplot2/

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_lb, color = species, fill = species), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Penguin Body Mass, by species",
    x = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_lb, color = species)) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Penguin Data, by species",
    x = "Flipper Length (in mm)",
    y = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

`ggplot2` makes it really easy to make beautiful and professional graphs and it would be a **really** useful skill to have in your career

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = bill_depth_mm,
    group = species
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = species, shape = species),
    size = 3,
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
    subtitle = "Bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Bill depth (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species",
    shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
    plot.caption.position = "plot"
  )
```
