# Dataframes (or, a group of vectors)

Dataframes are a special object in R. 
A dataframe is simply a collection of **vectors** and looks like a typical excel spreadsheet.
The columns of a dataframe are each **vectors** that contain variables and a row contains an **observation**.
This is the coding equivalent of an excel spreadsheet. 
If you are using Positron, clicking the dataframe in the `Variables` tab or typing `View(df_name)` into the console will let you interactively scroll though the data. 

First, we will load some data.frames that come with a **package** in R.
We can do that using the `data` function.
Let's load the `penguins` data set which contain a census conducted on multiple species of penguins on a set of islands:
![Three species of penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/main/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)

```{r}
data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins")
```

We can use the `head()` function to view the first few rows. 
It prints out the first 6 rows of the dataset so you can see the variables. 
BTW, this function works on vectors too!

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

Another helpful function is `str()` which prints a similar format, but is a little easier to read, especially when there are a lot of variables in the dataset. 

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

The output of string shows that a data.frame is just a list of vectors that have names (`species`, `island`, ...). 

Finally, you can access the number of rows and number of columns with `nrow`/`ncol`

```{r}
print(paste0(nrow(penguins), " obs. of ", ncol(penguins), " variables"))
```

#### Exercise

1. What constitutes a row in the penguins dataframe? What constitutes a column?


## Accessing vectors by name with `$`

The first thing we might want to do is access some of the vectors from the `penguins` dataframe. 
If you type `species` into the console and hit enter, you will see this error: `Error: object 'species' not found`. 
Get used to recognizing this error becuase you will probably accidentally make this mistake a lot at first.

This errors occurs because R does not know that you mean "look for `species` in the `penguins` dataset".
To access an individual vector, we must specify *both* the dataframe and the vector's name. 
To do this, we use the `$` operator like this: `penguins$species`. 
This looks into the dataframe stored in the `penguins` variable and looks for the vector named `species`:
```{r}
penguins$species
```

When using Positron, after you type the `$` a little pop-up menu wil show up that shows you all the available variable names.
You can use the arrow keys to find the variable and hit enter (or tab) to have it type the variable name for you.

Try that below to find the avariable measuring the depth of a penguin's bill:
```{r}

```


## General subsetting with `[,]` 

Now, let's think about subsetting the dataframe to a specific set of rows. 
Given that we used `[idx]` for vectors (either a logical vector or integer index), you might think we can do the same with data.frames.
This is good intuition, but remember a data frame has both rows and columns!
We will still use `[,]` to subset, but we need a `,` to specify rows and columns.

The syntax therefore is `df[ROWS, COLUMNS]`. 
Before comma = rows and After comma = columns.
If either `ROWS` or `COLUMNS` is left blank, then it will assume you want all rows or all colums respectively.

Let me show you some examples:

```{r}
## First 5 rows, all columns
penguins[1:5,]
```

```{r}
## All rows, the species column
penguins[, "species"]
```

```{r}
## First 5 rows, the species column
penguins[1:5, "species"]
```

```{r}
## First 10 rows, the species and island columns
penguins[1:10, c("species", "island")]
```


You can "chain" together calls and between `[,]` and `$` syntaxes.
For example let's say I want the variable `island` for the first 6 observations:
```{r}
penguins[1:6, "island"]
penguins[1:6, ]$island
```

But, if I do `penguins$island`, this results in a vector. 
So, to get the first 6 elements, I use only `[]` without a comma:
```{r}
penguins$island[1:6]
```

#### Exercise

1. Use the `unique()` function to find the unique values of the variable `species` in the penguins dataset.

```{r}

```

2. Use the `table()` function to find how many penguins there are of each species.

```{r}

```

3. Imagine we use `penguins[1:5]` to try and grab the first 5 rows. What happens?

```{r}

```



## Selecting rows based on criteria

Lets see which penguins live on Torgersen.

We can use the `==` operator to compare a vector to a value (or set of values). 
For example, here we see if each penguin's island is `"Torgersen"`. 
It produces a `boolean` vector of TRUEs and FALSEs

```{r}
on_torgersen <- penguins$island == "Torgersen"
on_torgersen
```

We can subset the data using a boolen vector.
We pass this boolean vector to the `ROWS` section of `[,]`

```{r}
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]
penguins[penguins$island == "Torgersen", ]$body_mass_g
```

You can also use the following operators to supply multiple criteria:
- `&` And operator. Both vector 1 **and** vector 2 must be true for the observation
- `|` Or operator. **Either** vector 1 **or** vector 2 must be true for the observation

```{r}
penguins$island == "Torgersen" & penguins$sex == "male"
penguins$island == "Torgersen" | penguins$sex == "male"
```


#### Exercise

1. Subset the `penguins` dataframe to male penguins that weigh over 3500 grams

```{r}

```


2. Are all three species present on the Torgersen island? The `table` or `unique` functions might be helpful here.

```{r}

```

3. Which species has the heaviest penguin? 

```{r}

```

4. 



#### Exercise

![Penguin Beak Measurements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/culmen_depth.png)

Lets compare Bill Length between the three species of penguins in our dataset: the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.

Using `[]` and `<-`, create 3 dataframes called `penguins_ad`, `penguins_gent`, and `penguins_chin` that subset based on the correct species of penguins.

"Adelie", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap"

```{r}

```


What is the mean of each species bill length in millimeters? (remember there are NAs so we will need to use `na.rm = TRUE`).

```{r}

```


## Creating new variables

We can create *new* variables in our dataset by using the `$` or `[]` operators with `<-`.

```{r}
penguins$body_mass_g

# 0.0022 lbs = 1 g
penguins$body_mass_lb <- 0.00220462 * penguins$body_mass_g
```


### Exericse

Your R exercise asks you to calculate the standard deviation without using the `var()` or `sd()` command. We want to remove `NA`s manually to fix this. A helpful command is `is.na()`. Let's practice computing the variance of body_mass_lb by hand. You will want to use `nrow()`

```{r}

```


## Loading data into R

In R, you can either load data from a website or from a computer. 
Usually data is found in a .csv file, but sometimes it will be in different forms that R can read.

```{r}
# From a website
fandango <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylebutts/UARK_4753/refs/heads/main/R_Labs/Lab_02/data/fandango_score_comparison.csv")
head(fandango)
```

However, most common is to download the data and put it in the folder where your `.Rmd` file is. 
To load data you will need to find the file location. 
By default, the working directory is whereever the `.qmd` file is located. So if your dataset is in the same folder as `.qmd`, you can load it by name:
```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
penguins <- read.csv("data/penguins.csv")
```

Or, say you have your data in a subfolder called `data`.
Then, you would use `penguins <- read.csv("data/penguins.csv")`.

If you have a dataframe that you want to export to a csv function, you will use the function `write.csv(df, "path/to/file.csv")`. 
This uses the same working directory as `read.csv` and relative paths to the file work the same way.  



## Sorting dataframes

There are two different ways to sort the rows of a data.frame.

First, we can use the `order` method we used on vectors: `df[order(...), ]`.

```{r}
penguins[order(penguins$body_mass_g), ]
```

Or, we can use special function `sort_by`.
This takes two arguments: 1. the `data.frame` and 2. the vector you want to sort by: 

```{r}
sort_by(penguins, penguins$body_mass_g)
```

Alternatively, we can pass a one-sided **formula** that gives the variables you want to sort by.
A **formula** is a commonly used tool in R that lets you write variable name(s) without needing to specify the `data.frame` they come from.  
A one-sided formula is written as `~ xvar` (the tilde is next to the number 1 on your keyboard). 

```{r}
sort_by(penguins, ~body_mass_g)
```

Say we want to first sort by species (so that each species is a contiguous chunk of rows) and then within species, sort by body mass. 
To do so, we can use multiple variables separated by a `+` in the formula syntax.

```{r}
sort_by(penguins, ~species + body_mass_g)
```



# Plotting

## Histograms

Common functions for graphing are `hist()` for plotting one variable and `plot()` for plotting two variables. 

```{r}
# Count
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```

You can add additional commands for better plots. Use `?hist` to see the list of options. 

#### Exercise

1. Type `?hist` into the console and find the following options:

- Find the option that will give you probabilities (instead of counts)
- the bar color
- the x-axis label
- the main title

Change these to make a more professional histogram:
```{r}
## Modify this
hist(penguins$body_mass_lb)
```


2. Compare this distributions of `bill_length_mm` for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. 

```{r}

```


## Scatter Plots

While we haven't talked about this yet, it is typically of interest to compare multiple variables together. 
To plot two variables, we will use the `plot()` function to make scatter plots.

```{r}
plot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_lb, main = "Scatter plot of flipper length and body mass")
```

It can be kind of annoying to type `penguins$` twice in plot.
There is a second way to call `plot` which uses **formula** syntax.
A formula has the following syntax `yvar ~ xvar` where `yvar` and `xvar` are variable names.
So we can use `body_mass_lb ~ flipper_length_mm` to specify variables and then tell `plot` to use the `penguins` data.frame using the `data` argument.
```{r}
plot(
  body_mass_lb ~ flipper_length_mm, 
  data = penguins, 
  main = "Scatter plot of flipper length and body mass"
)
```

If the `data` argument is not provided, it will look for `body_mass_lb` and `flipper_length_mm` as variables defined in the **global environment**. 
If these variables are within a data.frame and not as their own variables, then you will get the "object not found" error again.

The reason I am showing you this is that this syntax will show up again when we run linear regressions in this class.
And, in fact, this form of function calling where we use a `data` argument and then reference variables *within* that data.frame by name is actually quite common (see `dplyr` section in advanced materials).




## (optional) ggplot2

There is a package called `ggplot2` that improves base Rs graphing library. 
We will not cover the details here, but a curious student can find much more details here: https://ggplot2-book.org/

This is a particularly nice introduction: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/post/06-ggplot2/

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_lb, color = species, fill = species), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Penguin Body Mass, by species",
    x = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_lb, color = species)) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Penguin Data, by species",
    x = "Flipper Length (in mm)",
    y = "Weight (in lb.)",
    color = "Species",
    fill = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  theme_gray()
```

`ggplot2` makes it really easy to make beautiful and professional graphs and it would be a **really** useful skill to have in your career

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = bill_depth_mm,
    group = species
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = species, shape = species),
    size = 3,
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
    subtitle = "Bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Bill depth (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species",
    shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "inside",
    legend.position.inside = c(0.85, 0.15),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
    plot.caption.position = "plot"
  )
```
