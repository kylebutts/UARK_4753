This R lab will focus on learning and understanding the forecasting techniques used by the very popular open source package `prophet` by Facebook.

First let's load our `lubridate` package and the `prophet` package (you will likely need to install this). Second, there is a small bug in their code that I fixed, so run the `source()` line below to fix it. 

Finally, we load in our Peyton Manning wikipedia views daily time-series. Prophet is a bit odd and require our data to have *specific* names, `ds` for date and `y` for the outcome variable.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(prophet) # install.packages("prophet")

# I fixed a small bug, we will see if it is merged by next year's class
# https://github.com/facebook/prophet/pull/2641
source("temp_prophet_fix_seasonality.R") 

library(ggplot2)
theme_set(
  theme_light() + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank())
)

df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/prophet/main/examples/example_wp_log_peyton_manning.csv")
df$ds <- ymd(df$ds)

plot(x = df$ds, y = df$y, type = "l")
```


## Default parameters

By default `prophet` is set up to do a really good job at forecasting daily time-series data (the people at Facebook do a lot of this...). 

First, we call `prophet()` which sets up model parameters (we will leave them all blank to accept their defaults). We will store it in a variable we call `m`. Then, we call `fit.propet()` on `m` and our data frame (`df`) and save it back into `m`.

```{r}
# Default prophet call
m <- prophet()

# the date column must be `ds`
# the outcome variable must be `y`
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
```

Somewhere internally, `prophet` has set up our predictors and run a time-series regression model. To see how it performs, we will complete the forecasting. First, let's create a `future` dataset which really just extends our `df$ds` into the future by the number of days specified in `periods`:

```{r}
# Extend `df$ds` into the future by `periods` days
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
```

Next, we will call `predict` using our fit model `m` and the `future` data frame.
```{r}
forecast <- predict(m, future)
```

We can plot the forecast using `plot(m, forecast)`:
```{r}
plot(m, forecast)
```

We can also "peak" into the time-series components using `prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)`:

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```



## Breaking down how `prophet` creates a forecast

Let's build up the `prophet` model piece by piece to figure out what it's doing. 
To do so, let's disable all of the model parameters so that we have a completely uninformative forecast:

```{r}
# Disable everything
m <- prophet(
  growth = "flat", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = FALSE,
  weekly.seasonality = FALSE,
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```



There are three main terms in the forecast:
$$
y_t = S_t + T_t + H_t + \varepsilon_t,
$$
where
- $S_t$ is the seasonality term (e.g. day-of-year, day-of-week, and time-of-day)
- $T_t$ is the trend term (e.g. linear or piece-wise linear)
- $H_t$ is the "holiday" term (e.g. a set of indicators for "holidays" like holiday time, covid, etc.)

We will add in each term one-by-one to the forecast



### Yearly seasonality using Fourier series

Let's add in a day-of-the-year seasonal pattern. The way `prophet` does this is using a Fourier series, i.e. smooth combinations of sine and cosine curves with period equal to 365.25 days.
Let's start with 


```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with fourier order 1
m <- prophet(
  growth = "flat", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = 1,
  weekly.seasonality = FALSE,
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with fourier order 3
m <- prophet(
  growth = "flat", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = 3,
  weekly.seasonality = FALSE,
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
m <- prophet(
  growth = "flat", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = TRUE,
  weekly.seasonality = FALSE,
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```



### Weekly seasonality using Fourier series

Next, we will do the same with day-of-week patterns using `weekly.seasonality` parameter. Let's again start with 1 and then extend to the default (3). 

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
# & weekly seasonality with fourier order 1
m <- prophet(
  growth = "flat", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = 10,
  weekly.seasonality = 1,
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
# & weekly seasonality with the default order (3)
m <- prophet(
  growth = "flat", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = 10,
  weekly.seasonality = 3,
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```



### Piece-wise linear trends

So we have seen how `prophet` fits repeating patterns: day-of-the-year, day-of-the-week, and (if we had sub-daily data) time-of-the-day. 

The second compenent is adding piece-wise linear trends where the number of change points and where they are located are selected "optimally" by the data.

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
# & weekly seasonality with the default order (3)
# & linear trend
m <- prophet(
  growth = "linear", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 0, 
  yearly.seasonality = "auto",
  weekly.seasonality = "auto",
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast) +
  add_changepoints_to_plot(m)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```


Let's now upgrade to a piece-wise linear trend with a change point that starts when he was traded to the Broncos (2012-03-07):

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
# & weekly seasonality with the default order (3)
# & piece-wise trend with 1 (potential) change point (automatically chosen)
m <- prophet(
  growth = "linear", changepoints = c("2012-03-07"), n.changepoints = 1, 
  yearly.seasonality = "auto",
  weekly.seasonality = "auto",
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast) +
  add_changepoints_to_plot(m)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```


If we leave `changepoints = NULL`, the model will instead automatically chose where the changepoint is

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
# & weekly seasonality with the default order (3)
# & piece-wise trend with 1 (potential) change point (automatically chosen)
m <- prophet(
  growth = "linear", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 1, 
  yearly.seasonality = "auto",
  weekly.seasonality = "auto",
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast) +
  add_changepoints_to_plot(m)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```


The default is to allow 25 change points (that's a lot!). But note the model does not need to use all of the change points if the model determines it is starting to overfit the time-series sample

```{r}
# Yearly seasonality with the default order (10)
# & weekly seasonality with the default order (3)
# & piece-wise trend with the default number of (potential) change points (25) (automatically chosen)
m <- prophet(
  growth = "linear", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 25, 
  yearly.seasonality = "auto",
  weekly.seasonality = "auto",
  holidays = NULL,
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast) +
  add_changepoints_to_plot(m)
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```



### Holiday indicators

Last, we will add holiday indicators. Here too, `prophet` is particular about the column names. I've added the days he played in a playoff game and when he played in a superbowl game.

```{r}
playoffs <- data.frame(
  holiday = "playoff",
  ds = ymd(c(
    "2008-01-13", "2009-01-03", "2010-01-16",
    "2010-01-24", "2010-02-07", "2011-01-08",
    "2013-01-12", "2014-01-12", "2014-01-19",
    "2014-02-02", "2015-01-11", "2016-01-17",
    "2016-01-24", "2016-02-07"
  )),
  lower_window = 0,
  upper_window = 1
)
superbowls <- data.frame(
  holiday = "superbowl",
  ds = ymd(c("2010-02-07", "2014-02-02", "2016-02-07")),
  lower_window = 0,
  upper_window = 1
)
holidays <- rbind(playoffs, superbowls)

m <- prophet(
  growth = "linear", changepoints = NULL, n.changepoints = 25, 
  yearly.seasonality = "auto",
  weekly.seasonality = "auto",
  holidays = holidays
)
m <- fit.prophet(m, df)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 90)
forecast <- predict(m, future)

plot(m, forecast) + 
  add_changepoints_to_plot(m) 
```

```{r}
prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)
```

## Trying with bitcoin daily price data:

```{r}
bitcoin <- read.csv("data/bitcoin_daily.csv")
bitcoin <- bitcoin[, c("date", "price_close")]
colnames(bitcoin) <- c("ds", "y")
bitcoin$ds <- ymd(bitcoin$ds)

plot(x = bitcoin$ds, y = bitcoin$y, type = "l")
```


Fit a prophet model using the defaults and plot the forecast (using `plot`) and then plot the components (using `prophet_plot_components`). Predict out for 45 days into the future.

```{r}
# Fit model and plot fitted predictions

```
```{r}
# Components

```


### Questions

Consider a scenario where you work at a financial firm. You want to tell your boss to buy bitcoin if you forecast the price going up, but *really* don't want to be wrong. 

1. What does your forecast predict to happen to the future price of bitcoin? Using your plot components, write why you think the forecast might be missing the recent jump in prices?

ANSWER HERE


2. Using your components plot, describe what you are assuming about the time-series trend when making the forecast. Should this make you feel cautious about your recommendation?
